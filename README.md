# Page-Replacement-Simulator
### üìå Project Overview
This project is a Page Replacement Simulator designed to help understand how different page replacement strategies work in an Operating System's virtual memory management.
### üß∏ Simple Explanation
Imagine you have a small bag (memory) that can only hold a limited number of books (pages). But you have a huge bookshelf (hard drive) full of books. If you need a book that isn‚Äôt in your bag, you must remove an old book to make space for the new one. The question is: which book should you remove?

Different strategies (algorithms) answer this question in different ways, like:
- FIFO (First In, First Out) ‚Äì Remove the oldest book first.
- LRU (Least Recently Used) ‚Äì Remove the book you haven‚Äôt read for the longest time.
- Optimal (OPT) ‚Äì Remove the book that you won‚Äôt need for the longest time in the future (perfect but unrealistic).
This simulator will allow you to test these strategies with sample data and see how efficient they are.
### üñ•Ô∏è Technical Explanation
This project simulates page replacement algorithms used in demand paging in virtual memory systems. It tracks page faults, where a page needed by a process is not in the main memory and must be loaded from secondary storage.
### ‚ú® Features
- Simulates FIFO, LRU, Optimal (OPT) page replacement algorithms.
- Takes input as page reference sequences and frame size.
- Displays step-by-step execution of the algorithms.
- Shows page fault count and efficiency comparison.
- Provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy interaction.
### ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:
  - tkinter (for GUI)
- Execution Mode: Graphical User Interface (GUI)
### üèóÔ∏è Project Structure
This project is divided into three main modules:
1. GUI Module (gui.py)
- Uses Tkinter to create a user-friendly interface.
- Allows users to input page reference sequences and choose an algorithm.
- Displays step-by-step execution and a visual representation of memory frames.
2. Page Replacement Logic (algorithms.py)
- Implements FIFO, LRU, and Optimal algorithms.
- Returns page fault counts and memory state at each step.
- Acts as the backend for the GUI.
3. Simulation Controller (controller.py)
- Acts as the bridge between GUI and Algorithms.
- Calls the appropriate page replacement function.
- Formats and sends the results to the GUI for display.
4. Entry Point (main.py)
- Serves as the entry point that launches the GUI.
### üöÄ How It Works Internally
- User inputs a sequence of page requests and memory frame size via the GUI.
- The controller module processes the input and calls the appropriate algorithm.
- The algorithm module executes the logic and calculates page faults.
- The GUI displays step-by-step memory updates and final results.
### üìå Future Enhancements
- Visualizations using matplotlib.
- Support for additional algorithms (LFU, CLOCK etc.)
- More interactive GUI with animations
### ‚¨áÔ∏è Requirements/Installation
- <b>IDE:</b> Make sure to have any IDE on your device (VS Code in my case).
- <b>PYTHON:</b> Check if Python is installed in your device by entering this command in Command Prompt:
  
  ```sh
  python --version
  ```
  - If Python is installed, something like this will appear - Python X.XX.X (indicates version)
  - Else, install Python from here - [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - When installing Python, check the box: ‚úÖ "Add Python to PATH" before clicking install OR add it manually to PATH later from Environment Variables.
  - Check by running the above mentioned command again.
- <b>TKINTER:</b> It comes pre-installed with Python.
  - Check if tkinter is working using this command:
    
    ```sh
    python -c "import tkinter; tkinter._test()"
    ```
  - If a small GUI window pops up, tkinter is working and you're ready to go.
  - If not, try running this command:
    
    ```sh
    pip install tkinter
    ```
- <b>RUN:</b> Now everything is ready and you just need to CLONE this Repository to your device and execute the program.
  - To clone this repository, enter this command:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/arpan-dey-xo/Page-Replacement-Simulator
    ```
